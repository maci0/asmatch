refactor(core): align function names with conventions

Refactors the core processing functions to align with the `noun_verb` naming convention outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This improves the consistency and long-term maintainability of the codebase.

The following changes were made:
- Renamed functions in `asmatch/core.py` (e.g., `get_tokens` to `code_tokenize`).
- Updated all call sites for these functions in `asmatch/cli.py`.
- Renamed fuzzer files and updated their code to use the new function names.
- Updated all tests in `tests/test_asmatch.py` to reflect the changes.
- Verified the refactoring by running the full test suite.
